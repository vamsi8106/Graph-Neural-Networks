## GCN Community Classification on Karate Club Dataset

This project implements a small demo Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to classify nodes in the Zachary's Karate Club graph based on their structural connections and node features.

## 🚀 Features

- Loads the classic Karate Club dataset
- Splits data into training and test sets
- Builds and trains a multi-layer GCN model
- Evaluates accuracy on test nodes
- Visualizes predictions vs ground truth
- Saves and loads the trained model
